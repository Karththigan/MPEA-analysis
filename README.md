# Mechanical Performance Data Analysis of Multi-Prinipal Element Alloy (MPEA)

Investigating the mechanical properties of alloys and studying the relationships between them is important because many real-world contexts require alloys with properties that are optimized for specific applications. For this reason, this project conducted various statistical analyses, using R, of a Multi-Principal Element Alloy (MPEA) dataset. This dataset includes the values of various mechanical properties for 630 multi-principal element alloys.
